# 👽 Christopher Clemmons
🧪☢Fullstack Engineer + Data Scientist 

I'm `@christopherclemmons`, an indie hacker and business nerd with a passion for cloud computing and ai. I'm known for helping people get their ideas out to the market as fast as possible

## About Me
I love building saas 

## 🚀Core Values
- 👨‍💻 I believe humans should not be forced to use crappy software
- 🧠 Think before you code (so you don't waste time and money)
- 📝 You should ALWAYS write documentation (not doing so is a sin)
- 🛠 Time is the most valuable resource you have. 
- 📝 It's our software, not mine (no one takes all the credit, because we're a team)
- 📖 Share inforfmation with others (gatekeeping is rude and counterintuitive for every engineering team)
